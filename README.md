# Hackintosh on the Thinkpad L440 and T440p

![](XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXINSERIR IMAGEMXXXXXXXXXXXX)

**NOTE:** Hackintosh-ing is a process that's against the Apple® macOS™ End-User License Agreement (EULA). I am not responsable for any legal problems you may or may not be involved in for installing macOS™ on non-Apple hardware, as I'm not providing the media for installing macOS™, but rather, open-source software that can be used for the purpose of Hackintoshing, which is not against to the EULA for it's own.</br>

## What works (as of now, march 19, 2022):
- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi
- Graphics acceleration
- Trackpad and gestures
- SD card reader
- Battery management
- Continuity
- Microphone and speaker

Notes:</br>
1. Bluetooth on this installation does not have the common issue across other EFIs, which is weak signal.
2. Wi-Fi works out-of-the-box with the AirPort™ utility and native Wi-Fi menu.
3. Not all Continuity features work. AirDrop™ is known to not work with Intel® Wi-Fi cards, Handoff™ does work as of now, Universal Clipboard hasn't been tested but it's very likely to work.

## What DOES NOT work:
- XXX

Notes:</br>

1. This is a known issue that will be fixed soon.
